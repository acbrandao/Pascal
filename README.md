I'm a rcoverying Delphi Developer (and Trubo PAscal before then), back in its hey day (mid-1990's) when most folks were using Visual Basic, I wa scranking out soe sweet apps with Borlands Delphi, they predecessor to  Lazarus it was my tool of choice when I needed to develop ''native'' applications for Windows or Linux and sometimes for the Mac (Apple Sucks because they don't let you cross-compile unless you use  a Mac)..

Anyways, this is my repo of projects and examples mostly for Lazarus (aka Delphi). Some folks even consider it a great language for "retro" computing.. http://fetchrex.com/2017/04/16/pascal-the-perfect-language-for-retro-computing/
