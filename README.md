![alt text](https://github.com/acbrandao/Pascal/edit/master/lazarus_pascall.jpg "Lazarus Pascal IDE ")


I'm a rcoverying Delphi Developer (and Trubo PAscal efore then), back in its hey day when most folks were using Visual Basic, so now that Lazarus is my tool of choice when I need to develop ''native'' applications for Windows or Linux and sometimes for the Mac (Apple Sucks because they don't let you cross-compile unless you use  a Mac).. Anyways, this is my repo of projects and examples mostly for Lazarus (aka Delphi). Some folks even consider it a great language for "retro" computing.. http://fetchrex.com/2017/04/16/pascal-the-perfect-language-for-retro-computing/
