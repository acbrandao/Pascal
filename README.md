I'm a recoverying Delphi Developer (and Trubo PAscal before then), back in its hey day (mid-1990's) when most folks were using Visual Basic, I was cranking out some sweet apps with Borlands Delphi, the predecessor to  Lazarus it was my tool of choice when I needed to develop ''native'' applications for Windows .. Fast forward to today and its a mobile applications and web world, so they hey day of rich client apps is likely behind us for good, but when they're needed, try Lazarus and Object Pascal and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Anyways, this is my repo of projects and examples mostly for Lazarus (aka Delphi). Some folks even consider it a great language for "retro" computing.. http://fetchrex.com/2017/04/16/pascal-the-perfect-language-for-retro-computing/
